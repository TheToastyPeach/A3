            <p class="maingrid__p">Errol Morris decided to host a survey in&nbsp;2012&nbsp;for&nbsp;The&nbsp;New&nbsp;York&nbsp;Times. After receiving&nbsp;45,000&nbsp;responses from readers, it&nbsp;was&nbsp;observed&nbsp;that  John Baskerville's 250&nbsp;-&nbsp;year&nbsp;-&nbsp;old&nbsp;font&nbsp;made people more optimistic&nbsp;when&nbsp;compared to other fonts. This&nbsp;said,&nbsp;the&nbsp;font received criticism close to&nbsp;its&nbsp;creation&nbsp;from opposing designers, stating&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;sizing in the typography's curves&nbsp;made&nbsp;it&nbsp;"hurt the eye".

            <p>My concept for this site was a font sampler and what it would look like on the web. These posters are often made with print in mind, meaning stunning design, but very static compositions. I didn't want to abandon this completely, but I also wanted to make the most of creating a similar subject in a web environment. Playing on the history of my chosen font, I wanted a somewhat mesmerizing or hypnotic design that would still appear friendly on the surface. For this, I chose lighter colours and a more minimal composition, maximizing viewer engagement with the type and its different moving forms on the page. <br>I wanted to challenge myself to create a web design using only HTML and CSS as many of my recent designs have relied heavily on the implementation of JS. The 10 concepts I used were 2D and 3D transforms, nth-child selectors, calc() functions, CSS perspective, CSS columns, :has() selectors, a LAB colour space, SVGs, and HTML entities. Although the possibilities with these tools are huge, the amount of time to do what a graphic design program would do instantly is admittedly frustrating as learning a new feature often means reformatting!</p>
